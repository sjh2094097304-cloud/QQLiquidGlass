 * app-agnostic — they work off view geometry. What is not portable is finding
 * the bar in the first place: both WeChat and QQ run their resource ids through
 * AndResGuard, so an id lookup by name is worthless in either, and the only
 * stable handles are the UI class names. Those are collected here so adding a
 * third app is a matter of one more entry rather than a sweep through the code.
 *
 * <p>Structurally the two are near twins, which is why one installer covers
 * both: a full-bleed content view with the tab bar floating over it inside a
 * FrameLayout, an opaque drawable behind the bar, and one method the app calls
 * on every page switch.

     * {@code QQTabWidget} — a plain {@code android.widget.TabWidget} inside

     * material {@code TabLayout}) behind the flag. Both sit as a bottom-gravity
     * child of the same {@code DragFrameLayout}, over a full-screen content
     * view, and both take {@code setCurrentTab(int)} on every switch.

     * <p>{@code QQBlurViewWrapper} is QQ's own 54dp frosted strip behind the
     * bar. Left visible it would sit between the glass and the page it is
     * supposed to refract, so it is hidden on install.
     *
     * <p>{@code getCurrentTab()} only answers on one of the two. QQ's copy of
     * the material {@code TabLayout} has been patched to carry it, so
     * {@code QQTabLayout} inherits one; {@code QQTabWidget} declares no getter
     * and {@code android.widget.TabWidget} has none either. It is named here
     * for the bar that does answer — the other falls through to reading the
     * selection off the tabs, which is where it lives anyway.
